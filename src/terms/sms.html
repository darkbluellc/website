      <h1>SMS Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
      <p class="meta"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> <span>26 Dec 25</span></p>
    </header>

    <p>
      These SMS / Text Messaging Terms &amp; Conditions (“SMS Terms”) govern the use of text messaging services
      (the “SMS Service”) provided by <strong>Darkblue, LLC</strong>, a Massachusetts limited liability company
      (“Darkblue,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).
    </p>
    <p>
      By enrolling in, accessing, or using the SMS Service, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these SMS Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Purpose of the SMS Service</h2>
    <p>
      The SMS Service is used solely to support operational communications related to an online medical control phone
      system for Emergency Medical Services (“EMS”). Messages are <strong>non-promotional</strong>,
      <strong>one-way</strong>, and intended only to notify enrolled users of incoming or related system events
      associated with phone calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SMS Service is <strong>not</strong> used for marketing, advertising, or general notifications unrelated to the
      EMS phone system.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility and Authorized Users</h2>
    <p>
      The SMS Service is available <strong>only to authorized employees</strong> who have accounts within the system and
      who have affirmatively opted in during account creation or onboarding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SMS Service is intended for use <strong>within the United States only</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Consent and Opt-In</h2>
    <p>
      Enrollment in the SMS Service occurs as part of account signup or system onboarding. By enrolling, you expressly
      consent to receive SMS messages related to the operation of the EMS phone system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkblue maintains <strong>timestamped records of consent</strong> associated with each enrolled account.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Message Frequency</h2>
    <p>
      Message frequency is <strong>event-driven</strong> and corresponds to incoming phone calls or system activity.
      There is <strong>no fixed message cap</strong>, and messages may be sent as frequently as system activity requires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Receipt of these messages is directly tied to your voluntary participation in the underlying phone system.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Opt-Out</h2>
    <p>
      You may opt out of the SMS Service at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong> to any message.
    </p>
    <p>Upon opting out:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You will no longer receive SMS messages from the system.</li>
      <li>Re-enrollment requires a new opt-in through account settings or administrative action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Nature of Messages</h2>
    <p>
      Messages sent via the SMS Service:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are operational and informational only</li>
      <li>Do <strong>not</strong> include marketing or promotional content</li>
      <li>Do <strong>not</strong> intentionally include protected health information (PHI), financial data, or other
        sensitive personal information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, SMS is not a guaranteed or encrypted communication method. You acknowledge that message delivery may be
      delayed, interrupted, or fail due to factors outside Darkblue’s control.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Service Availability and Reliability</h2>
    <p>
      The SMS Service is provided on an <strong>“as-is” and “as-available” basis</strong>. Darkblue does not guarantee
      message delivery, timeliness, or availability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SMS Service relies on third-party telecommunications providers and infrastructure, and interruptions may occur
      due to carrier issues, network outages, or technical limitations.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the SMS Service for any purpose other than its intended operational function</li>
      <li>Attempt to interfere with, disrupt, or misuse the messaging system</li>
      <li>Share access to the SMS Service with unauthorized individuals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Darkblue reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to the SMS Service for misuse or violation of these SMS
      Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Modification or Termination</h2>
    <p>
      Darkblue may modify, suspend, or discontinue the SMS Service at any time, with or without notice, including
      changes required to maintain compliance with carrier or regulatory requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continued use of the SMS Service after any modification constitutes acceptance of the updated SMS Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, Darkblue shall not be liable for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any failure or delay in message delivery</li>
      <li>Any damages arising from reliance on SMS notifications</li>
      <li>Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages related to the SMS Service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The SMS Service is a supplemental notification mechanism and should not be relied upon as the sole means of
      communication for critical operational decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These SMS Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
      <strong>Commonwealth of Massachusetts</strong>, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
