    </header>

    <p>
      This SMS Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how <strong>Darkblue, LLC</strong>, a Massachusetts limited
      liability company (“Darkblue,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), collects, uses, stores, and discloses information
      in connection with its text messaging (“SMS”) services.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Policy applies solely to SMS-related data and is independent of any general privacy policy that
      may otherwise apply to Darkblue’s products or services.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope of the SMS Service</h2>
    <p>

      one-way, and limited to system-related notifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SMS service is available only to authorized users who have affirmatively opted in and is intended
      for use within the United States.

      information.
    </p>

      <li>Internal troubleshooting and operational support</li>
    </ul>

      <li>To service providers involved in hosting or operating the SMS infrastructure</li>
      <li>To the organization that engaged Darkblue to develop and manage the EMS phone system, provided such
          information is anonymized and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual</li>
      <li>To law enforcement or governmental authorities when required to do so by law, regulation, or legal
          process</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

      for their independent use.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      SMS-related information is retained on an <strong>indefinite basis</strong> for operational,
      auditing, and compliance purposes, unless and until it is no longer required or is removed as part of
      system maintenance or decommissioning.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>

      Darkblue maintains reasonable administrative and technical measures designed to protect SMS-related
